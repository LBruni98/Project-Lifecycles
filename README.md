# Project Lifecycles

#### Waterfall
The waterfall lifecycle is a linear approach towards each of the events. Generally, the events represent a stage within the project development and generally approached at one at a time, finishing before the next stage can begin. Before a next one can begin however, a stage gate is placed in-between the stages for review by a customer before the next stage can begin.

Advantages of this lifecycle are that, first, it allows for the agreement of what can be delivered early by the customer and developer, which can make designing and planning more easier and that anyone can contribute towards the project at any time or work on different projects. Customers are only involved in the reviewing process, meaning that the presence of a customer is not required. Integration with external systems is easier, due to the design being completed early in the lifecycle and finally, this lifecycle can give clearer understandings of project deliverables. This means, the project can progress to its maximum; software can be designed completely and the project can be approach more carefully.

Disadvantages of this lifecycle are that it falls short on the effectiveness of the requirements, as the requirements are gathered later in the project lifecycle for use within later stages and the prototype, making it too risky for a customer to make requirements too early. Also, changes are costly in this type of project development and all the deliverables are based on the requirements with the customer not being able to see it until the stage gate, with a possibility that the customer will not be satisfied with the results when being shown.

#### Evolutionary
The evolutionary lifecycle model is iterative, with the projects being divided into smaller products over a series of sprints. It encourages continuous improvement through a team’s ability to inspect and adapt the iteration processes.

The advantages of this methodology are that it reduces the risk of project failure because of the product being delivered at each interval and at which the product can be assessed and improved through each sprint. A concept may be pitched in the form of an actual product which funding would attract more attention and that the product in this state gives the client an idea on what the final product can look like. Also, it assists to find earlier problems within the design, requirements etc.

The disadvantages, however, are that the product goes through a lot of changes and that could damage the structure and can result in the product not being to a high standard expected from the requirement. The user and producer could get too involved leading to the project becoming vastly different due to the amount of changes or legal involvement could be an issue. Due to the length that this methodology can cause, the project’s client may cause a lack of interest and cancellation, even having larger user numbers can slow down the development.

#### Prototyping
Prototyping is a method of software development recently increasing in popularity, in which software prototypes which display what the product could look like. It helps with what the user wants exactly and that the designers can get an idea of how the product should look and function within development. Different variants of this methodology are the Evolutionary (see above), Throwaway and Incremental Prototyping methodologies.

The advantages of this methodology are that users get a better idea of the system being developed, being more involved with the project before its implementation. Another advantage being that the defects within that product are recognized earlier and easier and that this can help with time and cost being reduced.

The disadvantages are that the product is too dependent on the prototype, which can cause problems such as the lack of requirement analysis and potentially the user being confused as to which is the prototype and which is the actual product. The developer may try to use the prototype mostly throughout the development, trying to reuse them for the actual system which is almost technically impossible.

#### Spiral
The spiral method is a combination of linear and iterative development focusing on incremental refinement around the spiral and has a high emphasis on risk analysis.
The project continuously goes through four phases: Identification, Design, Building and Evaluation.

The spiral model is more towards a better flow of development where there are no conflicts between past requirements and designs, so it can allow for requirement changes, extensive use of prototypes. Development can be broken down into smaller parts, with risky parts being developed earlier.

Spiral, however, requires a very strict management to complete the project, being that the management and process are more complex and requires loads of documentation. The main risk though being that the development process may not have an end and the spiral could go on indefinitely.

Spiral mainly caters towards projects of substantial risk, if resources are minimal and the project must have a long-term commitment because of the constantly changing requirements. Smaller or lower risk projects suffer, along with it being too expensive for smaller projects.

#### Rapid Application Development (RAD)
RAD or Rapid Application Development is a methodology that uses little to no planning for rapid prototyping and mainly focuses on developing modules in parallel to create the main product at a rapid pace.

The main advantage of RAD is that the product is and developed and shipped faster; develop time is reduced and feedback is quicker. Other advantages include integration of the product at the very beginning, solving a lot of integration issues that could’ve come up later and requirements can be changed within the development time.

The downside of RAD are that management is extremely complex and requires constant user involvement. Good skill is needed within development and design to build the system with this method.

The RAD methodology is mainly for developers and designers with a substantial amount of skill and if there are no budget constraints in development. The project can use RAD if the product can be modularized for incremental delivery and can be used if automated code generating tools are granted permission.

#### Traditional X Agile
This methodology basically blends both traditional and agile developments to one. Traditional project management runs in a sequential cycle, mainly being more controllable with a clear goal, while Agile development is more iterative, allowing for different ideas and self-organizing. The Combination may result in Scrummerfall or WaterScrum.
The idea is that it tries to combine the flexible nature of agile development and the more ordered waterfall method. The methodology has the development carried out in a waterfall within planning and release while the development and design is done through agile means.

This methodology isn’t considered by many developers, mainly because of the methodology being unable to handle uncertainty and change. The agile development needs to involve change and often than not, the developer would just resort to using agile rather than combing the two.

The only benefit would be it would help developers, presenting this methodology as a starting point, but it wouldn’t be sustainable if the developer would want to use agile development.

#### Formal / Light Formal
Formal/Light Formal Methods are mathematical approaches within software development, creating a foundation for a complex system and supporting the development of that product, mainly in implantation and testing.

Using formal methods can help discover a lot of problems within the software and can grow effectiveness within each iteration. More is that it is not involve a high complexity rate and the software being delivered is mainly without any defect.

This model however can be expensive and time consuming to which a good deadline would be needed when creating this software. This type of development doesn’t see to many developers use it as extensive training is required to implement this model successfully, so it would be very difficult for others and the customer may not understand the techniques given, making the project unlikely to get funded
