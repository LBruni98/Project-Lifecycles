# Project Lifecycles

#### Waterfall
The waterfall lifecycle is a sequential lifecycle and a linear approach towards each of the events. Generally, the events represent a stage within the project development and generally approached at one at a time, finishing before the next stage can begin. Before a next one can begin however, a stage gate is placed in-between the stages for review by a customer before the next stage can begin.

##### Advantages of Waterfall
Advantages of this lifecycle are that, first, it allows for the agreement of what can be delivered early by the customer and developer, which can make designing and planning easier and that anyone can contribute towards the project at any time or work on different projects. Customers are only involved in the reviewing process, meaning that the presence of a customer is not required. Integration with external systems is easier, due to the design being completed early in the lifecycle and finally, this lifecycle can give clearer understandings of project deliverables. This means, the project can progress to its maximum; software can be designed completely and the project can be approach more carefully.

##### Disadvantages of Waterfall
Disadvantages of this lifecycle are that it falls short on the effectiveness of the requirements, as the requirements are gathered later in the project lifecycle for use within later stages and the prototype, making it too risky for a customer to make requirements too early. Also, changes are costly in this type of project development and all the deliverables are based on the requirements with the customer not being able to see it until the stage gate, with a possibility that the customer will not be satisfied with the results when being shown.

##### Examples of When to Use it
This lifecycle, being more linear, is more for toward projects that have a little to no chance of changing its requirements during its overall development. If the tasks are also straightforward and organized within the project, then it is suitable to use the Waterfall lifecycle, because it works when requirements are clearly specified and fixed. Other factors to use this lifecycle is that there are no ambitious features or requirements and that the project is relatively short.

#### Evolutionary
The evolutionary lifecycle model is iterative, with the projects being divided into smaller products over a series of sprints. It encourages continuous improvement through a team’s ability to inspect and adapt the iteration processes. The system in the evolutionary lifecycle constantly evolves during development which are shown to the customer for feedback. Based on the feedback for the version developed, it is used for future development, changing in time before finally creating the system to the client’s expectations and releasing that version.

##### Advantages of Evolutionary
The advantages of this methodology are that it reduces the risk of project failure because of the product being delivered at each interval and at which the product can be assessed and improved through each sprint. A concept may be pitched in the form of an actual product which funding would attract more attention and that the product in this state gives the client an idea on what the final product can look like. Also, it assists to find earlier problems within the design, requirements etc.

##### Disadvantages of Evolutionary
The disadvantages, however, are that the product goes through a lot of changes and that could damage the structure and can result in the product not being to a high standard expected from the requirement. The user and producer could get too involved leading to the project becoming vastly different due to the amount of changes or legal involvement could be an issue. Due to the length that this methodology can cause, the project’s client may cause a lack of interest and cancellation, even having larger user numbers can slow down the development.

##### Examples of When to Use it
This model works best when the customer is unsure what to what they want and developers work with little to no requirements.  The main issue is the ever changing requirements that the client makes, which could overall damage the structure and change the overall product, which could risk the customer not being satisfied, so this model should be used if there is a team that can understand where to start from and can plan each iteration as the requirements keep changing.

#### V-Model
The V-Model Lifecycle is a sequential lifecycle and has similar functions to the waterfall model. The life cycle is so called because of it similar V-shaped sequential path and each phase of development must be completed before the next one can begin. Even though it has all the similarities with Waterfall, it has a system plan put in place before any initial development can begin.

##### Advantages of V-Model
V-Model is simplistic and easy to use, allowing for the requirements to be understood. It is also considered to be a superior alternative to the Waterfall lifecycle model and this is because that planning and designing takes place before coding, saving a lot of time and ensuring a higher success rate. Defects in this lifecycle are detected early and can be dealt with almost instantly, adding to the higher success rate.

##### Disadvantages of V-Model
The lifecycle, like its Waterfall counterpart, is rigid and least flexible, not allowing much in the way of change. Should change happen within the lifecycle, any supporting requirement or test documents need to be updated, taking up valuable time. Another disadvantage is that software is developed during the implementation portion of development, so no prototypes can be produced for proper testing.

##### Examples of When to Use it
It is mainly beneficial to use this model if the project is small or medium scale, with the requirements being, as stated earlier, understood and fixed. Another factor to consider when using this model is that it should be chosen when the technical resources are available with technical expertise. Without any prototypes and high risk is involved, the customer must have a lot of confidence with the company in order to properly and successfully use this model.

#### Spiral
The spiral method is a combination of linear and iterative development focusing on incremental refinement around the spiral and has a high emphasis on risk analysis.
The project continuously goes through four phases: Identification, Design, Building and Evaluation. Through these phases, the software is passed through here repeatedly in iterations or Spirals within this model. The baseline spiral is more of a planning phase, where requirements are gathered and risk is evaluated. Each spiral is structured and builds upon the baseline spiral.

##### Advantages of Spiral
The spiral model is more towards a better flow of development where there are no conflicts between past requirements and designs, so it can allow for requirement changes, extensive use of prototypes. Development can be broken down into smaller parts, with risky parts being developed earlier.

##### Disadvantages of Spiral
Spiral, however, requires a very strict management to complete the project, being that the management and process are more complex and requires loads of documentation. The main risk though being that the development process may not have an end and the spiral could go on indefinitely.

Spiral mainly caters towards projects of substantial risk, if resources are minimal and the project must have a long-term commitment because of the constantly changing requirements. Smaller or lower risk projects suffer, along with it being too expensive for smaller projects.

##### Examples of When to Use it
It is beneficial to use this model when the important aspects are the cost and the risk, as it cracks down on these factors to ensure a high success rate. Spiral is useful if the project may go throughout a lot of changes and if the project is more medium or high-risk, as the software can be continuously built on to ensure that it is developed well throughout these opposing factors.

##### How Risk is Managed in Spiral
The spiral model is similar to the incremental model, but risk analysis plays more of an important part, being that it’s a crucial phase in the model, after the planning phase. In this, a process is carried out to identify the risks and to find any alternate solutions, with a prototype being developed at the end of this phase. When any risk is found, developers would suggest solutions and these are implemented, this in turn helps the project with eliminating any risk earlier for a more stable development and product.

This lifecycle helps with any higher risk, bigger and/or costly projects where risk could be very prominent and the iterative nature of the spiral allows the project to head back to that phase, allowing for more risk assessment and better solutions to be implemented, allowing for improvement and change within the project.
